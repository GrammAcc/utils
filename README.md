# utils
Common helper functions I use in different environments.

This repo is only a reference of some common functions I end up writing in a lot of my
projects, so Issues are disabled and PRs will be immediately closed.

If you find any of these functions useful or if there is a better/more efficient
implementation for them, feel free to open a discussion about it. :)

One module/file per PL. If you want to use these helpers, probably just copy/paste from
the online viewer into your local editor.
